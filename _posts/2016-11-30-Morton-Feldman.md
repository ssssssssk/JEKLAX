"For me at least sound was the hero, and it still is. I feel that I'm subservient. I feel that I listen to my sounds, and I do what they tell me, not what I tell them. Because I owe my life to these sounds. Right? They gave me a life." — Morton Feldman.

LAXART and Monday Evening Concerts are pleased to collaborate on a special presentation of Morton Feldman's late-career masterwork for flute, piano, and percussion *Crippled Symmetry* (1983). This concert marks the opening of MEC's 78th season. In *Crippled Symmetry*, Feldman creates a hushed world in which sonic lines function both interactively and independently. The piece was inspired by the intricate patterning of Anatolian rugs, Proust's transfiguring fog of memory, and by the perpetually evolving mobile-form sculptures of Alexander Calder. Subtly unfolding over the course of ninety minutes, *Crippled Symmetry* is Feldman's meditative, existential response to the urgencies and anxieties of modern life.

The concert will be performed inside of Kim Fisher's solo exhibition *A Little Bit of But* (November 12, 2016–January 7, 2017) which comprises the artists largest installation to date and a new body of abstract and text-based paintings. This exhibition is made possible in part by a grant from the City of Los Angeles, Department of Cultural Affairs.

Seating will include lounge areas of 19th century rugs and pillows on the floor, with a limited number of chairs available on a first come first serve basis. Anatolian rugs generously provided by Claremont Rug Company, a rug gallery devoted entirely to art–level Oriental rugs woven from approximately 1800 until 1925. Blüthner piano and Concert Celesta generously provided by Kasimoff-Blüthner Piano Company of Hollywood.

Special thanks to Jan David Winitz, Claremont Rug Company, and Kasimoff-Blüthner Piano Company.
