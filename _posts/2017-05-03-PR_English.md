The catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement, the Till case remains a potent gauge for our progress as a society.  Images were key to the event&rsquo;s ability to go from being a case to being a cause.  As an affront to the imagination, the iconic image of Till&rsquo;s mutilated body poses questions deeply critical of art.  Please join LAXART&rsquo;s Director, Hamza Walker and University of Chicago art historian Darby English for an informal discussion surveying visual representations of the Till case.  

Darby English is the Carl Darling Buck Professor of Art History  at the University of Chicago and a consulting curator at MoMA.  He has written numerous essays and is the author of two books, *How to See a Work of Art In Total Darkness* (MIT Press) and *1971; A Year in the Life of Color* (University of Chicago Press).
