Join Glenn Phillips and Elena Shtromberg, curators of *Pacific Standard Time LA/LA: Video Art in Latin America*, for a discussion and tour of exhibition highlights. Featuring more than 60 time-based works from over 19 countries, this show surveys groundbreaking achievements and important thematic tendencies in Latin American video from the 1960s to the present.

Following the walk through, LAXART will present a special screening of the documentary *Do Outro Lado do Rio (Across the River)* (2004, 88 minutes) by artist Lucas Bambozzi, whose video *Oiapoque-L’Oyapock* (1998, 10 mins) in the Borders and Migrations program is a prequel to this feature length film.  Exploring the highly transited border between Oiapoque, Brazil and St. Georges de L’Oyapock, French Guyana, the artist documents the stories of Brazilians who are dissatisfied with the conditions they live in and seek to cross into the French territory laying just across the river.

This exhibition is curated by Glenn Phillips, Curator and Head of Modern & Contemporary Collections at the Getty Research Institute, and Elena Shtromberg, Associate Professor of Art History, University of Utah.
