LAXART is pleased to present a dialogue between filmmaker Cauleen Smith and art historian and curator Rhea Anastas. How—right now, today—can we care for U.S. everyday social life? In reconsidering this pressing question of the here and now, Smith and Anastas will discuss two areas of recent work by the filmmaker. A film drawn from Smith’s research on the influence of the music and life of Alice Coltrane (1937-2007), with recordings from signal Coltrane compositions, and three works drawn from an area of Smith's work best described as activist response, a multiplicity of work rooted in Chicago, where Smith has lived since 2011. These works differ in their effects, taking on the locations (public, the street, the worldwide web) and functions of activism (being loud, using your body, making informal networks for self-education and information dissemination). These include *LESSONS IN SEMAPHORE* (2013), a digitized16mm film and *HUMAN_3.0 READING LIST* (2016), an iphone film of Smith’s essential readings as drawings. Smith's *GWENDOLYN BROOKS BANNERS* for *The Black Love Procession: Conduct Your Blooming* (2016) took a part of a poem by Gwendolyn Brooks and mobilized it as a renegade procession that took place in Bronzeville, a historically black Chicago neighborhood. This procession responded to a controversial exhibition by an artist whose work about the death of Michael Brown was presented at a gallery in Bronzeville. Smith and Anastas will focus on these projects as they intersect with broader initiatives of the Black Lives Matter movement—a movement that solidified a national discourse and set of policy proposals in the summer of 2015, and that carries forward an urgent platform against race and class oppression in the US context today. 


Smith was awarded the 2016 Alpert Award in visual art and was the first recipient of The Ellsworth Kelly Award from the Foundation for Contemporary Art, given to the artist for Give It Or Leave It, a solo exhibition linked to The Warplands by research and a book. Give It Or Leave It is forthcoming at the Institute of Contemporary Art, University of Pennsylvania in 2018. 


__About the Artist__
Smith is known for a group of influential films and videos, moving image installations and objects with connections to experimental film and third world cinema; structuralism and science fiction. A California native, Smith was born in Riverside, grew up in Sacramento and was educated at San Francisco State University (BA) and the University of California, Los Angeles (MFA, Film). Recent films, such as Crow Requiem and The Way Out Is the Way To, move between Smith’s active study of multiple histories and archives (avant-garde, African-American histories and improvisational music), and Smith’s response to recent and ongoing violence against people of color at the hands of the state.

This program is co-presented with the University Art Galleries, University of California, Irvine, where Cauleen Smith’s exhibition, The Warplands, opens January 14, 2017, curated by Rhea Anastas.
