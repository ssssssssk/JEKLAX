Join us for a discussion with four of the original core members of Environmental Communications (Roger Mona Webster, David Greenberg, Ted Tokio Tanaka FAIA, Bernard Perloff).  Billed as a talk/listen, the discussion will be in two parts.  The first will focus on the counter cultural impulse behind the founding of EC, the means and ends of the project, and the area of expertise (architecture, photography psychology) each member brought to the collective. For the second part of the discussion EC would like to hear from the audience, particularly millennials, about their relationship to the material and what if any relevance it has for today.

The exhibition was first produced by GSAPP Exhibitions for the Arthur Ross Architecture Gallery at Columbia University&rsquot;s Graduate School of Architecture Planning and Preservation.

This expanded version of the exhibition appears with the assistance of the University of Southern California School of Architecture.

Generous support for research on Environmental Communications was provided by the Graham Foundation.

Curated and designed by Mark Wasiuta, Marcos SÃ¡nchez and Adam Bandler
