1987 was the 200th Anniversary of the U.S. Constitution.  To mark the occasion, the New York art collective Group Material organized a group exhibition simply titled *Constitution*. Featuring over 40 artists, *Reconstitution* is a wholesale recasting of *Constitution*. Like the original, the works run the gamut from folk to conceptual art. The show will also utilize Group Material’s mode of display—painting the gallery walls on which the art hangs with the text of the U.S. Constitution. For *Reconstitution*, however, the U.S. Constitution will be rendered in Farsi as a means of asking to whom are this nation’s ideals legible?  To juxtapose the U.S. Constitution against works of contemporary art is to claim the Constitution as a living document, one that harbors ideals against which we monitor our progress as a society.
